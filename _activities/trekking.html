            Trekking is a recreational outdoor adventure activity which uses an inflatable raft to navigate a river. It is one of the most extreme adventure activities as well as most enjoyable for adventure lovers and explorers. The northern region of India is considered as the best place for adventurous activities such as rafting, camping, trekking and paragliding. The rivers originating from the Himalayas are considered the best match for rafting. From the narrow rivers, rafting is an activity of immense fun and thrill. The "narrow" part of the river increases the flow of water, which is very thrilling for the people sitting on the raft and challenging for the raft guide.
